# Meteor: Fullstack JavaScript Development

The rate of innovation in the JavaScript space is still incredible. For a while, it seemed that Angular would emerge as a winner in the web application frontend wars. Now, with Meteor, there is a new contender, a full-stack development framework which promises "to allow you to build advanced apps quickly, with a small team &ndash; allowing even individuals to achieve things that used to be possible only at large companies like Google and Facebook."

We wanted to gain some experience with Meteor with a very small project (approx. 20d, two people) to form our own opinion on these promises. We were quite impressed, as our estimates of what we would be able to build were way off: We developed roughly 50% more functionality than we had estimated. Meteor seemed easy to learn, and we very quickly felt very productive with Meteor.

In this presentation, we give a short overview on Meteor (with its Distributed Data Protocol, Latency Compensation, and Reactivity) and its components for rendering (Blaze) and testing (Velocity) as well as its package system (atmosphere.js). In a "slide coding" session, we implement a "lessons learned" feature of our demo application, Retro42 (<a href="https://retro42.herokuapp.com">retro42.herokuapp.com</a>) as a showcase for coding with Meteor.
